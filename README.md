Khabar - Apni Suno, Apni Batao
"Khabar" (which means "news" or "message" in Hindi) is a sleek and modern social media feed UI, designed to provide a clean and intuitive user experience. This project focuses on a distinct visual theme: all written text is black, while interactive elements, icons, and accents are a vibrant light orange.

This UI is built with HTML5 and CSS3, emphasizing responsive design, accessibility, and maintainability through modern CSS practices like variables.
